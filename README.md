# Java Fundamentals Demo

## Description
This project demonstrates core Java concepts in a single file (`Main.java`).  
It covers:

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (including overloading)
- Instance and Static Methods
- Method Overloading
- Final Methods
- Static Variables
- Primitive and Object Data Types
- User Input using Scanner

This is ideal for beginners who want to see all fundamental Java concepts working together in one place.

All classes are nested in `Main.java` for simplicity:
- `Printer` – prints strings, integers, and objects; demonstrates constructors and static methods.
- `InputHandler` – reads integers, doubles, and strings from the user.
- `Checker` – checks if a number is odd/even; demonstrates final methods.
- `ExampleStatic` – demonstrates static variables and static methods.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open terminal/command prompt in the folder containing `Main.java`.
2. Compile the file:

```bash
javac Main.java
```
3. Run the program:

```bash
java Main
```

## Features

Static Methods: Can print messages without creating objects.

Constructors: Can initialize objects and print messages automatically.

Method Overloading: Demonstrates multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

Final Methods: Showcases methods that cannot be overridden.

Static Variables: Shared values across all objects of a class.

User Input: Reads integers, doubles, and strings using Scanner.
